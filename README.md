# Discrete Structures Project

This repository contains the project work for the KTU module on **Discrete Structures**. The project explores various concepts such as **set theory**, **graph theory**, **combinatorics**, and **cryptography**, all of which are fundamental topics in discrete mathematics.

## Topics Covered through the course:

### 1. Set Theory
- Subsets and algorithms for generating subsets.
- Operations on sets and programming those operations.

### 2. Graph Theory
- Basic concepts in graph theory.
- Graph operations and their representation in computing.
- Depth-first and breadth-first search algorithms.
- Key numerical properties in graph theory.
- Planar graphs, trees, Euler and Hamiltonian paths.
- Optimal pathfinding algorithms.
- Vertex degree sequences.

### 3. Combinatorics
- General principles of combinatorics.
- Algorithms for generating combinatorial objects.
- Recurrence relations and generating functions.

### 4. Cryptography
- Alphabetic coding, optimal codes (Shannon–Fano, Huffman codes).
- Data compression (Lempel–Ziv algorithm) and error-correcting codes.
- Introduction to cryptography, types of attacks, symmetric-key systems.
- Mathematical foundations of cryptography.
- Public-key cryptography.
